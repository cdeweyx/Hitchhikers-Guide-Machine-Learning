    "We are going to implement MDP in a grid world of 3 x 4 space where our agent/robot is situated at (1,1) in the beginning and needs to reach (3,4) state which is its desired goal state. There is also a fault state at (2,4) which the robot needs to avoid at all costs. The movement of the robot from one state to another earns it a reward. Naturally, the reward for the goal state is the highest and the least for the fault state. The objective of the robot is to maximize its reward and thus plan its movements/actions accordingly. It can move in any direction and this is a stochastic process."
